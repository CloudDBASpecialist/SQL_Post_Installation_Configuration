# SQL Post-Installation Configuration

Welcome to the SQL Post-Installation Configuration repository! Here, we gather a collection of scripts and guidelines for configuring SQL servers after installation. These scripts aim to streamline the post-installation process and ensure optimal performance and security.

Please note that you need to modify the scripts below according to your environment.

- **05_Setup_DBA_Operator:** Change the operator name and email address.
- **07_Create_SQLDBA_Login:** This script creates an SQL login to manage all SQL servers. You can use this login for tasks such as creating registered servers or utilizing it in SQL monitoring tools.
- **08_Setup_Email_Profile_and_Account:** Modify the domain name and mail server name (IP) in this script.
- **21_Create_DBA_Accounts:** Update the script by inserting all your DBA team usernames.

## Contributing
